# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/png/
    - assets/lottie/
    - assets/translations/
    - assets/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MavenPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/maven_pro/MavenPro_Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/maven_pro/MavenPro_Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/maven_pro/MavenPro_Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/maven_pro/MavenPro_SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/maven_pro/MavenPro-Medium.ttf
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Thin.ttf

    - family: Inria Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/inria_sans/InriaSans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/inria_sans/InriaSans-Italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/inria_sans/InriaSans-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/inria_sans/InriaSans-Regular.ttf
